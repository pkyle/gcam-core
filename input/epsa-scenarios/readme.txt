this set of folders and files contains the model inputs for the S5, S6, S7, and S8 scenarios. The scenarios are run by copying the files from these folders into the appropriate places in the GCAM data system, and re-running the makefiles to re-build XML files. Because some modifications are made to the energy-data/level0/UCD_transportation_database.csv file, it is often necessary to re-run the gcam-data-system makefile prior to the gcam-usa-data makefile. These will generate xml/gcam-usa-xml/transportation_USA.xml and building_USA.xml files that can then be saved with the correct appended suffix.
