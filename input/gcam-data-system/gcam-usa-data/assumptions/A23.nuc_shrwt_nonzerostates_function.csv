# Interpolation function for states with nuclear energy in the calibration year.,,,,,,
# The shrwts are linear from calibration year to 2020 (to 0.2) and then fixed to 0.2 to 2100. ,,,,,,
# NOTE: The interpolation function “linear from 2010 to 2020” works if and only if a shrwt of 0.2 (or any other value) is specified in the assumption file: ,,,,,,
